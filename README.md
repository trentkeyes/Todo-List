Check it out here: https://trentkeyes.github.io/Todo-List/

Todo List app inspired by the Odin Project assignment. The user can add tasks, add details like a description, due date, and priority level, and sort them into projects. The user can add and view project pages on the sidebar. Click on a to-do task to edit its details. Completed or "checked off" projects can be viewed at the bottom of the sidebar.
