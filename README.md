# To-Do List App

---

[Live app](https://trentkeyes.github.io/Todo-List/)

Inpsired by the [the Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) and Todoist. Created with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

User can add "To-Do" tasks, edit details, create projects and view tasks by associated project. The user's data is stored locally on their device.

### Features

- Add tasks and optionally include a description, due date, priority level and associated project.
- Add a project and view associated tasks (the default project is "Inbox").
- Edit a task by clicking on it.
- "Check off" items and view completed tasks.
- Tasks and projects are saved locally.

### Features to add

- Responsiveness for smaller screens (currently looks best on a larger screen).
- Delete projects and edit project name.
- Delete locally stored tasks and projects.
- Reorder tasks and projects.
- Un-delete completed tasks.
- Option to view all tasks on one screen (currently all tasks are sorted to their associated project view).

### I learned about

- In-depth details about DOM manipulation
- Creating objects with classes and factory functions.
- Local storage API
- Creating a ''pop-up" form using positioning and JS.
